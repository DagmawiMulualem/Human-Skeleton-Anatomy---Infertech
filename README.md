Developed a human skeleton AR app using Xcode, Swift, and ARKit, designed to enhance educational experiences in anatomy. 
The app allows users to interact with a 3D skeleton model, identifying bones and providing detailed descriptions upon selection. 
This project demonstrates my ability to create immersive, interactive tools that make complex subjects more accessible and engaging for students, 
combining technology with education in innovative ways."
